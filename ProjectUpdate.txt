### Project Update

Ball Blaster 2000 turned out very different than we had initially planned. Originally, we were building a table-tennis-esque game, where the user controls a paddle and tries to bounce a ball against the wall. We very carefully planned to write wrapper APIs that would abstract most of the Bullet/Ogre/OIS integration code, so that we could be free to write game logic.

Unfortunately, spending a bunch of time on the engine itself meant that the game process stalled as we worked on separate components. By the time the first deliverable rolled around, our game was pretty far behind the other teams. Because of this, our "demo" was simply the Ogre head with a mouse-controlled camera... pretty lame. However, since we had put in the time to build a well-abstracted engine, once we started actually working on the "meat" of the game itself things came together very quickly. Jacky wrote an XML parser to automate the loading of some of the model/scene files, which vastly expanded the intricacies of our scenes. Keegan then put together some excellent models, and the direction of our game shifted course very quickly! In the last day all the pieces came together, and we very quickly had a working "ball collector" game that was much better than our original idea.

Overall the game came together nicely, even if it was a bit rushed near the end. The important thing to us here was that we would be able to continue to build on this game throughout the next assignments, which we believe we have achieved.
