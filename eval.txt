Overall Team:
I think we have a really well balanced team. Joe is really good at Version control, debugging and team project management.
I am good at designing the game architecture. And Keegan is good at math related algorithm and 3D modeling.

We have a really good work split.

I think this is one of the best team I have even worked in.

My strengths:
1. Design pattern
2. Overall architecture design

Weaknesses:
1. Code speed is slow
2. Careless mistakes

Score:
Me: 9/10
Keegan: 9/10
Joe: 9/10

What I have learned:
1. Using c++ lambda as function pointer
2. Pure virtual function and pure virtual destructor
3. difference between dynamic cast and static cast
4. more C++ 11 features like auto keywork
5. string stream
